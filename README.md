# Alle5
Set of C++ functions to handle Generations 5 & 6 Pokémon text file format

This was created to be integrated in your C++ code to let you read, modify and expand Pokémon text text files
The workflow is really simple:
  - Use ``LoadAlle5File`` to read the text file and store each line as an entry of a ``std::vector<std::string>``
  - Add, remove or modify entries as you wish
  - Use ``SaveAlle5File`` to convert the ``std::vector<std::string>`` into a new text file
